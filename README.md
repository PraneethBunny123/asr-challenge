# VectorCam

This repository contains a simplified but intentionally imperfect review & annotation dashboard built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a small set of **shadcn/ui** components. The goal of the exercise is to evaluate your ability to reason about existing code, improve its structure, and design new features under realistic constraints.

## Running the project

1. Ensure you are using **Node.js 20.17.0**.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app. The task lives under the `/interview` route.

## Context

VectorCam is used by entomologists and public health program managers to review and annotate specimen data collected in the field. This exercise focuses on the **web dashboard** portion of the system (not the mobile capture pipeline). A **mock API** (`/api/mock/records`) serves an in‑memory list of records and supports `GET` and `PATCH` operations. Data resets whenever the server restarts.
